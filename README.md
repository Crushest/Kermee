# You Laugh, You Drink (Game)

Simple application that allows one to count the amount of times they've laughed so that when their turn is over they can save and take that many drinks. Then reset for next user. There is a red Hard Reset button that makes it appear as if the user has just opened the applications again. Planning on turning into chrome application.

Happy Coding!
